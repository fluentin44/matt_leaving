title: "Bioinformatics handoff"

This is a summary of my work, covering as far as possible. I have tried to make all the code as reproducible as possible - note there will still be some hashed out code in the scripts - this is 99% most likely because it is not needed, but has been used in the development of the code, so may be useful for reference at some point in time.

I've tried to provide the locations of project folders, including raw data and any materials which I used to support writing the respective code.
